This project was designed specifically for Club Fair event at Nazarbayev University. It is a combination of a landing website and a system, where you can attend certain events, scan QR code there and get points to win some valuable prizes hence. Unfortunately, to see the "system" part of the website you have to login, but I do not think it is possible at the moment. 

The project was deployed to production and served its purpose. The results generated by this system were considered as the only criteria for choosing the winners of the competition. 
The load peak for this was roughly 120 users at the same time


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
